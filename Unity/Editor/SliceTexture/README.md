# Slice Texture

Put this folder under the directory `"/Assets/Editor"` and you could find `"Create/Custom Operate/Slice to PNGs"` button when you right click the Project window.

**ATTENTION**: Make sure the texture's settings that you select are correct.

You should ENABLE `Read/Write Enabled` and `Alpha Is Transparency` options of the `Advanced` Item. Otherwise, it will report an error.
